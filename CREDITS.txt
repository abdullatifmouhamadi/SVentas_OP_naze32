This is a credits file of people that are or have been key contributors to the OpenPilot code base in this Git repository. 
Without the work of the people in this file and many that are not who help the community, OpenPilot would not be what it is today.

It is sorted alphabetically by name and formatted so that it allows for easy grepping and beautification by scripts.

The fields are:
